<h2>Education</h2>

<h4>PhD in Computer Science, University of Milano-Bicocca</h4>
<p><b>Start</b>: 2019 - <b>End</b>: 2023 </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">
The main subject of my PhD regards machine learning under uncertainty focusing on weakly supervised learning
and cautious prediction both from an algorithmic/theoretical as well as experimental point of view.
During my PhD I also collaborated with different hospitals in Italy (IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Galeazzi,
IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele) and abroad, on medical machine learning projects, also applying the above mentioned techniques.
</p>

<h4>Visiting Student, Heudiasyc, Université de Compiègne</h4>
<p><b>Start</b>: Sep 2021 - <b>End</b>: Dec 2021 </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">
During my PhD I spent 3 months as a visiting student at the Heudiasyc research lab, under the supervision of prof. Thierry 
Denoeux. During this period, my main research projects regarded studying the relationships between two important uncertainty
representation theories (rough set theory and belief functions) as well as their applications in knowledge representation
and machine learning, especially in clustering.
</p>

<h4>Master of Science in Computer Science, University of Milano-Bicocca</h4>
<p>
Final Vote: 110 cum laude<br>
<b>Start</b>: 2015 - <b>End</b>: 2017
</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">
The subject of my thesis regard the study of an algebraic model of uncertainty (orthopairs) and its relationships with other
uncertainty models. In particular, I was interested in studying the generalization of information theory to this setting, as well
as the applications of these ideas in the setting of clustering. <br>
My studies were mostly focused on theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. The main courses I followed regarded:
machine learning, probabilistic graphical models, representation of uncertainty, computational complexity theory, non-classical logics,
information theory, high-performance computing, dynamical systems theory 
</p>

<h4>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, University of Milano-Bicocca</h4>
<p>
Final Vote: 110 cum laude<br>
<b>Start</b>: 2012 - <b>End</b>: 2015 
</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">
    The subject of my thesis regard the use of causal graphical models for infering and representing the evolution of cancer. In 
    particular, I designed a pipeline for cancer data analysis based on these models.<br>
    My studies were mostly focused on theoretical computer science and data sciences. The main courses I followed regarded:
    algorithms and data structures, bioinformatics, probability and statistics, operations research and optimization, models of
    concurrent and dynamical systems, databases, mathematics (analysis, linear algebra, logics), computability theory
