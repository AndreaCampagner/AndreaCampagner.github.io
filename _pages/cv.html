<h4>PhD in Computer Science, University of Milano-Bicocca</h4>
<p><b>Start</b>: 2019 - <b>End</b>: 2023 </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">
My main research theme was uncertainty in machine learning, with a focus on weakly supervised learning and
cautious prediction, both from an algorithmic/theoretical as well as experimental point of view.
I have also been interested in uncertainty representation more in general, as well as Human-AI Interaction.
During my PhD I collaborated with different hospitals, in Italy (IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Galeazzi,
IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele) and abroad, on medical machine learning projects, also applying the above mentioned techniques.
My supervisors were <a href="https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=XxD_4bAAAAAJ">Davide Ciucci</a> and
