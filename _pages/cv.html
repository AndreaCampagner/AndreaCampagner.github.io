<h4>PhD in Computer Science, University of Milano-Bicocca</h4>
<p><b>Start</b>: 2019 - <b>End</b>: 2023 </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">
The main subject of my PhD regards machine learning under uncertainty, focusing on weakly supervised learning,
cautious prediction and uncertainty management, both from an algorithmic/theoretical as well as experimental point of view.
During my PhD I also collaborated with different hospitals, in Italy (IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Galeazzi,
IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele) and abroad, on medical machine learning projects, also applying the above mentioned techniques.
My supervisors were <a href="https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=XxD_4bAAAAAJ">Davide Ciucci</a> and
<a href="https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=Ydi0s1EAAAAJ">Federico Cabitza</a>.

During my PhD I spent 3 months as a visiting student at the Heudiasyc research lab, under the supervision of prof. 
<a href="https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=JEO5fHoAAAAJ">Thierry Denoeux</a>. During this period, my main research projects regarded studying the relationships between two important uncertainty
representation theories (rough set theory and belief functions) as well as their applications in knowledge representation
and machine learning, especially in clustering.

</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">
The subject of my thesis regarded the study of an algebraic model of uncertainty (orthopairs) and its relationships with other
uncertainty models. In particular, I was interested in studying the generalization of information theory to this setting, as well
as the applications of these ideas in the setting of clustering. <br>
My studies were mostly focused on theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. The main courses I followed were:
machine learning, probabilistic graphical models, representation of uncertainty, theoretical computer science and 
computational complexity, non-classical logics, information theory, high-performance computing, dynamical systems theory

</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">
    The subject of my thesis regarded the use of causal graphical models for inferring and representing the evolution of cancer. In 
    particular, I designed a pipeline for cancer data analysis based on these models.<br>
    My studies were mostly focused on theoretical computer science and data sciences. The main courses I followed were:
    algorithms and data structures, bioinformatics, probability and statistics, operations research and optimization, models of
    concurrent and dynamical systems, databases, mathematics (analysis, linear algebra, logics), computability and language theory,
