<h2>Education</h2>

<h4>PhD in Computer Science, University of Milano-Bicocca</h4>
<p><b>Start</b>: 2019 - <b>End</b>: 2023 </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">
The main subject of my PhD regards machine learning under uncertainty focusing on weakly supervised learning
and cautious prediction both from an algorithmic/theoretical as well as experimental point of view.
During my PhD I also collaborated with different hospitals in Italy (IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Galeazzi,
IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele) and abroad, on medical machine learning projects, also applying the above mentioned techniques.
</p>

<h4>Visiting Student, Heudiasyc, Université de Compiègne</h4>
<p><b>Start</b>: Sep 2021 - <b>End</b>: Dec 2021 </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">
During my PhD I spent 3 months as a visiting student at the Heudiasyc research lab, under the supervision of prof. Thierry 
Denoeux. During this period, my main research projects regarded studying the relationships between two important uncertainty
representation theories (rough set theory and belief functions) as well as their applications in knowledge representation
and machine learning, especially in clustering.
</p>

<h4>Master of Science in Computer Science, University of Milano-Bicocca</h4>
<p>
Final Vote: 110 cum laude<br>
<b>Start</b>: 2015 - <b>End</b>: 2017
</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">
The subject of my thesis regard the study of an algebraic model of uncertainty (orthopairs) and its relationships with other
uncertainty models. In particular, I was interested in studying the generalization of information theory to this setting, as well
as the applications of these ideas in the setting of clustering. <br>
My studies were mostly focused on theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. The main courses I followed regarded:
machine learning, probabilistic graphical models, representation of uncertainty, computational complexity theory, non-classical logics,
information theory, high-performance computing, dynamical systems theory 
</p>

<h4>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, University of Milano-Bicocca</h4>
<p>
Final Vote: 110 cum laude<br>
<b>Start</b>: 2012 - <b>End</b>: 2015 
</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">
    The subject of my thesis regard the use of causal graphical models for infering and representing the evolution of cancer. In 
    particular, I designed a pipeline for cancer data analysis based on these models.<br>
    My studies were mostly focused on theoretical computer science and data sciences. The main courses I followed regarded:
    algorithms and data structures, bioinformatics, probability and statistics, operations research and optimization, models of
    concurrent and dynamical systems, databases, mathematics (analysis, linear algebra, logics), computability theory
</p>

<h2>Work and Teaching Experience</h2>

<h4>Guest Lecturer on Weakly Supervised Feature Selection and Uncertainty in Dynamical Systems, MSc in Computer Science, University of Milano-Bicocca</h4>
<p><b>Start</b>: June 2021 - <b>End</b>: June 2021</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">
I teached two 2hrs lessons within the Master-level course "Complex and Uncertain Systems". 
The first lesson regarded the application of rough set theory and belief functions to feature selection in weakly supervised learning
problems. The second lesson regarded the application of rough set theory for uncertainty modeling and knowledge representation in 
discrete dynamical systems.
</p>

<h4>Lecturer on Explainability and Fairness in Artificial Intelligence, Master Degree in Nudge and Public Policies, University of Milano-Bicocca</h4>
<p><b>Start</b>: March 2021 - <b>End</b>: March 2021</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">
I teached a 4hrs course on Explainability and Fairness in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning: a 2hrs theoretical lesson
(1hr on explainability + 1hr on fairness) and 2hrs hands-on lesson (using Orange).
</p>

<h4>Teaching Assistant on "Languages and Computability", BSc in Computer Science, University of Milano-Bicocca</h4>
<p><b>Start</b>: November 2019 - <b>End</b>: September 2021</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">
I have been teaching assistant for the laboratory part of the Bachelor-level course "Languages and Computability". 
My responsibilities encompassed teaching and assisting students in the use of standard tools (lex, yacc) for parser generation.
</p>

<h4>Research Consultant, IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Galeazzi</h4>
<p><b>Start</b>: July 2019 - <b>End</b>: December 2019</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">
I worked at the IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Galeazzi (one of the major research hospitals in Italy) as a contract research consultant 
on machine learning and data reliability, mainly working on projects related to AI-supported diagnosis and explainable AI.
</p>

<h4>Clinical Data Scientist, Link Up and Deloitte Italy</h4>
<p><b>Start</b>: November 2018 - <b>End</b>: June 2019</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">
I worked as a machine learning and database engineer at Link Up (a start-up focusing on consulting services for hospitals), which
was later acquired by Deloitte Italy. In particular, I was the head of a small team (2 data scientists and 1 biomedical engineer)
working on database/data warehouse design and machine learning development consulting for different hospitals and clinics in Italy
and Europe.
