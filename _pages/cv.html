<h4>PostDoc Researcher, IRCCS Ospedale Galeazzi Sant'Ambrogio</h4>
<p><b>Start</b>: Dec 2022 - <b>End</b>: Dec 2023 </p>
<p><b>Location</b>: Milan, Italy</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">
    I am currently employed as a PostDoc Researcher at the IRCCS Ospedale Galeazzi Sant'Ambrogio, one of the most important
    research hospitals in Italy and Europe for radiology, orthopaedics, cardiology and metabolic disease research.
    My research is associated with the research project "Computational support for clinical and patient-centred decisions"
    and my main aims and research topics concern both Machine Learning (and, more broadly, Data Science) as well as 
    human-AI interaction. <br>
    On the ML side, my research regards the development and evaluation of ML techniques and algorithms for clinical
    applications, with a focus on the management of uncertain data, uncertainty quantification, and statistical learning
    methods for clinical decision-making based on patient-reported data (PROMs). <br>
    On the human-AI interaction side, my research regards the design and evaluation of AI-based clinical support systems and
    impact-assessment protocols in clinical decision making, based on a human-centered approach.
