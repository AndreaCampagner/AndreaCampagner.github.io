<h2 id="comet">I-COMET</h2>
The project aims at the development of a shared technological infrastructure for studying age-related diseases. The project has 
been funded through a grant of the Italian Ministry of Health (Convenzione Progetto di Rete), and involves several research 
hospitals in Italy (Principal Investigator: INRCA Ancona). Since 31/12/2023 I'm the team leader of IRCCS Ospedale Galeazzi
Sant'Ambrogio for machine learning and data science activities, as well as for coordination with other institutes involved
in the project.

<h2 id="softpy">softpy</h2>
softpy is a Python library for soft computing (in particular, fuzzy systems and evolutionary computing),
compatible with (and based on) scikit-learn.
I'm the primary developer and mantainer of the library, which was developed as a way to teach Bachelor-level students the
principles of soft computing, within the context of the Fuzzy Systems and Evolutionary Computing of the Bachelor degree in 
Artificial Intelligence at the University of Milano-Bicocca. The library has since evolved into a general-purpose library, albeit
still with an educational/academic (not production-ready) scope.
The library is open-source and available on <a href="https://github.com/AndreaCampagner/softpy">GitHub</a>.
The library currently focuses on implementations of fuzzy sets (both discrete and continuous), operations, fuzzy control systems
as well as general-purpose meta-heuristic algorithms (mainly population-based).

<h2 id="scikitweak">scikit-weak</h2>
scikit-weak is a Python library for weakly supervised learning, compatible with (and based on) scikit-learn.
I'm the primary developer and mantainer of the library, which also feature contributions by 
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=h521iR4AAAAJ">Julian Lienen</a> from Paderborn University.
The library is open-source and available on <a href="https://github.com/AndreaCampagner/scikit-weak">GitHub</a> and 
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/scikit-weak/">PyPi</a>.
The library currently focuses on learning from imprecise data, self-supervised learning
and label regularization problems, by providing a framework for management and representation of weakly supervised data,
state-of-the-art classification algorithms, as well as pre-processing, data management, and evaluation utilities.


<h2 id="dssquality">DSS Quality Assessment</h2>
DSS Quality Assessment is a Web Tool for the assessment of data-driven decision support systems, especially those based on AI and ML methodologies.
The Web Tool encompassess different functionalities to provide a holistic approach to quality assessment, in particular it allows to:
evaluate the similarity of datasets, evaluate the calibration and robustness of decision support systems, as well as evaluate the utility and impact
of a decision support system on human decision-making. The web tool was developed at the MUDI Lab of the University of Milano-Bicocca and draws from
multiple years of research conducted at the same lab. The web tool is available <a href="https://dss-quality-assessment.vercel.app/">here</a>.



<h2 id="covid">COVID-19 Blood-ML</h2>
The aim of this project was to develop diagnostic and prognostic models for COVID-19 disease, based on
blood test data. The project has led to the collection of multiple datasets from several hospitals and clinics
around 4 countries (Italy, Spain, Brazil, Ethiopia), which are publicly available (for benchmarking, analysis and model
development purposes) on Zenodo:
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/4081318#.Y3eYJ-TMK3A">
            Italian datasets from multiple clinics (IRCCS San Raffaele, IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Galeazzi), for diagnostic tasks
        </a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/4958146#.Y3eYLOTMK3A">
            Datasets from international hospitals and clinics (Italy, Brazil, Spain, Ethiopia), for diagnostic tasks
        </a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/4686707#.Y3eYN-TMK3A">
            Prognostic longitudinal dataset (IRCCS San Raffaele)
        </a>
    </li>
</ul>
The developed ML diagnostic models have been deployed through freely usable web-tools
<a href="https://covid19-bloodtests-ml.herokuapp.com/">COVID-19-BLOOD-ML</a> and
 <a href="https://covid-19-blood-ml.herokuapp.com/">COVID19-BLOODTESTS</a>, or as standalone models on
 <a href="https://github.com/AndreaCampagner/Development--evaluation--and-validation-of-machine-learning-models-for-COVID-19">GitHub</a>.
