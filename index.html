<h2>About me</h2>
I'm a Postdoc Researcher at the
<a href="https://www.grupposandonato.it/strutture/ospedale-galeazzi-sant-ambrogio">IRCCS Ospedale Galeazzi-Sant'Ambrogio</a>,
the major Italian research hospital devoted to orthopaedics and traumatology, where I work on applications of statistical and machine learning
methodologies to clinical decision making and clinical process management.
I also work as a Teaching Assistant at the University of Milano-Bicocca, and I'm an external collaborator and member of the
<a href="https://mudilab.disco.unimib.it/">MUDI (Modeling Uncertainty, Decisions and Interaction)</a> lab at the same university. <br><br>
Previously I obtained my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Milano-Bicocca, working in the MUDI lab.

My main research interests are <b>uncertainty management</b>, <b>machine learning</b>,
<b>medical AI</b> and <b>human-AI interaction</b>, as well as their intersection.
Therefore, I'm primarily interested in (and authored publications related to):
<ul>
    <li>Weakly supervised learning</li>
    <li>Cautious inference, uncertainty quantification and conformal prediction</li>
    <li>Soft clustering</li>
    <li>Applications of ML and uncertainty modeling in medical decision-making</li>
    <li>Human-AI interaction and explainable AI in clinical decision-making</li>
</ul>
My work has appeared in the top-ranked venues focusing AI, uncertainty representation and human-computer interaction
(including AAAI, CHI, MDAI, FUZZ-IEEE, INTERACT, VISIGRAPP as well as several Q1 journals).

I'm also interested and have authored publications (in no particular order) on the following topics:
<ul>
    <li>Formalisms for representing uncertainty (rough sets, fuzzy sets, belief functions, imprecise probabilities)</li>
    <li>Theoretical computer science (esp. learning theory/theoretical ML, dynamical systems, logics, algorithm design)</li>
    <li>Robustness, data reliability and robust ML</li>
    <li>Socio-technical and philosophical issues related to computer science and AI</li>
</ul>

I really believe in the co-operative nature of science (and mathematics), and thus I'm always open to collaborations or
simply to chat: if you want, you can contact me via Twitter or email (see left column!).

Also, do not hesitate to contact me for things which are not work related (even more fun!), including having a chat
on my (many) hobbies, which include: 
<ul>
    <li>Traveling (esp. in East Asia and Europe)</li>
    <li>Videogames (esp. role-play, action/adventure and metroidvania games)</li>
    <li>Reading novels (esp. sci-fi, magical realism, fictional history)</li>
    <li>Movies, series and animation</li>
    <li>Language learning (I'm fluent in Italian and English, and learning French and Japanese)</li>
    <li>Japanese pop culture</li>
    <li>Capoeira</li>
    <li>Dancesport (esp. Argentine dances and jazz dances)</li>
</ul>
