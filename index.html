<h2>About me</h2>
I'm a third year PhD student at University of Milano-Bicocca, working in the MUDI (Modeling Uncertainty, Decisions and Interaction)
 lab!<br><br>

My main research interests regard the <b>representation and management of uncertainty</b> and <b>machine learning</b>, as well as their intersection.
Therefore, I'm primarily interested in:
<ul>
    <li>Formalism for representing uncertainty (incl. rough and fuzzy sets, belief functions, imprecise probabilities)</li>
    <li>Weakly supervised learning</li>
    <li>Cautious learning and conformal prediction</li>
    <li>Learning theory and theoretical ML</li>
    <li>Design of ML algorithms (esp. ensemble methods)</li>
</ul>

I'm also interested in:
<ul>
    <li>Theoretical computer science (esp. dynamical systems, logics and algorithm design)</li>
    <li>Human-AI interaction and socio-technical implications of AI</li>
    <li>Medical AI/ML</li>
</ul>

I really believe in the co-operative nature of science (and mathematics), and as such I'm always open to collaborations or
simply to chat: if you want, you can contact me via Twitter or email (see left column!).

Also, do not hesitate to contact me for things which are not work related (even more fun!), including having a chat
on my (many) hobbies, which include: 
<ul>
    <li>Traveling (esp. in East Asia and Europe)</li>
    <li>Videogames (esp. role-playing, action/adventure and metroidvania games)</li>
    <li>Reading novels (esp. sci-fi, magical realism, fictional history)</li>
    <li>Movies, series and animation</li>
    <li>Japanese pop culture</li>
    <li>Dancesport (esp. Argentine dances and boogie-woogie)</li>
    <li>Language learning</li>
</ul>
