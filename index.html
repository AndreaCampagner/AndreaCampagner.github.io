<h2>About me</h2>
I'm a third year PhD student at University of Milano-Bicocca, working in the MUDI (Modeling Uncertainty, Decisions and Interaction) lab!<br>

My main research interests regard the representation and management of uncertainty, and machine learning as well as their intersection.
Therefore I'm interested in:
<ul>
    <li>Mathematical formalisms for representing uncertainty (probabilities, rough sets, three-way decision, fuzzy sets, belief functions, ...)</li>
    <li>Machine and statistical learning algorithms (esp. ensemble methods)</li>
    <li>Learning theory</li>
    <li>Conformal and cautious prediction</li>
    <li>Weakly supervised learning</li>
</ul>

I'm also interested in:
<ul>
    <li>Applications of AI in medicine</li>
    <li>Human-AI interaction</li>
    <li>Socio-technical implications of AI</li>
    <li>Theoretical computer science (esp. dynamical systems and nature-inspired computation)</li>
</ul>
