<h2>About me</h2>
I'm a PhD Candidate at University of Milano-Bicocca, working in the 
<a href="https://mudilab.disco.unimib.it/">MUDI (Modeling Uncertainty, Decisions and Interaction)</a> lab.<br><br>

My main research interests are the <b>representation and management of uncertainty</b> and <b>machine learning</b>, as well as their intersection.
Therefore, I'm primarily interested in:
<ul>
    <li>Formalisms for representing uncertainty (incl. rough and fuzzy sets, belief functions, imprecise probabilities)</li>
    <li>Weakly supervised learning</li>
    <li>Cautious inference and conformal prediction</li>
    <li>Soft clustering</li>
    <li>Learning theory and theoretical ML</li>
</ul>

I'm also interested (in no particular order) in:
<ul>
    <li>Medical AI/ML</li>
    <li>Human-AI interaction and explainable AI</li>
    <li>Theoretical computer science (esp. dynamical systems, logics and algorithm design)</li>
    <li>Robustness and robust ML</li>
</ul>

I really believe in the co-operative nature of science (and mathematics), and thus I'm always open to collaborations or
simply to chat: if you want, you can contact me via Twitter or email (see left column!).

Also, do not hesitate to contact me for things which are not work related (even more fun!), including having a chat
on my (many) hobbies, which include: 
<ul>
    <li>Traveling (esp. in East Asia and Europe)</li>
    <li>Videogames (esp. role-play, action/adventure and metroidvania games)</li>
    <li>Reading novels (esp. sci-fi, magical realism, fictional history)</li>
    <li>Movies, series and animation</li>
    <li>Language learning (I'm fluent in Italian and English, and learning French and Japanese)</li>
    <li>Japanese pop culture</li>
    <li>Capoeira</li>
    <li>Dancesport (esp. Argentine dances and jazz dances)</li>
    
</ul>
