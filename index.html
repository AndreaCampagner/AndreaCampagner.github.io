<h2>About me</h2>
I'm a PhD Candidate at University of Milano-Bicocca, working in the 
<a href="https://mudilab.disco.unimib.it/">MUDI (Modeling Uncertainty, Decisions and Interaction)</a> lab,
and PostDoc Researcher at the
 <a href="https://www.grupposandonato.it/strutture/ospedale-galeazzi-sant-ambrogio">IRCCS Ospedale Galeazzi Sant'Ambrogio</a>
.<br><br>

My main research interests are <b>uncertainty management</b>, <b>machine learning</b>,
<b>medical AI</b> and <b>human-AI interaction</b>, as well as their intersection.
Therefore, I'm primarily interested in (and authored publications related to):
<ul>
    <li>Weakly supervised learning</li>
    <li>Cautious inference, uncertainty quantification and conformal prediction</li>
    <li>Soft clustering</li>
    <li>Applications of ML and uncertainty modeling in medicine</li>
    <li>Human-AI interaction and explainable AI in clinical decision-making</li>
</ul>

I'm also interested (in no particular order) in:
<ul>
    <li>Formalisms for representing uncertainty (rough sets, fuzzy sets, belief functions, imprecise probabilities)</li>
    <li>Theoretical computer science (esp. dynamical systems, logics, algorithm design, learning theory/theoretical ML)</li>
    <li>Robustness, data reliability and robust ML</li>
</ul>

I really believe in the co-operative nature of science (and mathematics), and thus I'm always open to collaborations or
simply to chat: if you want, you can contact me via Twitter or email (see left column!).

Also, do not hesitate to contact me for things which are not work related (even more fun!), including having a chat
on my (many) hobbies, which include: 
<ul>
    <li>Traveling (esp. in East Asia and Europe)</li>
    <li>Videogames (esp. role-play, action/adventure and metroidvania games)</li>
    <li>Reading novels (esp. sci-fi, magical realism, fictional history)</li>
    <li>Movies, series and animation</li>
    <li>Language learning (I'm fluent in Italian and English, and learning French and Japanese)</li>
    <li>Japanese pop culture</li>
    <li>Capoeira</li>
    <li>Dancesport (esp. Argentine dances and jazz dances)</li>
</ul>
