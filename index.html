<h2>About me</h2>
I'm a third year PhD student at University of Milano-Bicocca, working in the MUDI (Modeling Uncertainty, Decisions and Interaction)
 lab!<br><br>

My main research interests regard the representation and management of uncertainty, and machine learning as well as their intersection.
Therefore I'm interested in different <b>mathematical formalisms for representing uncertainty</b>
(including <i>rough sets, three-way decision, belief functions, fuzzy sets, imprecise probabilities</i>); 
<b>machine learning algorithms</b> (esp. <i>ensemble methods</i>); <b>learning theory</b>; <b>conformal</b> and 
<b>cautious prediction</b>; as well as <b>weakly supervised learning</b>.<br><br>

I'm also interested in the <i>applications of AI/ML in medicine and Human-AI Interaction</i>; in the <i>socio-technical implications of
AI</i> (e.g., fairness, discrimination, explainability); and in <i>theoretical computer science</i> more in general, with a particular 
focus on studying <b>uncertainty in dynamical systems</b>.<br><br>

If you want to chat with me about my work you can contact me via Twitter or email (see left column!). Also, you can contact me if 
you simply want to have a nice chat about my (many) hobbies, which include: <i>traveling</i></traveling> (esp., in Asia and Europe),
 <i>language learning</i>, <i>videogames</i> (esp., role-playing and adventure games), <i>literature</i> and <i>movies/series</i>, as
well as <i>dancesport</i> (Argentine dances and jazz dances).
